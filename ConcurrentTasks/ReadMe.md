# Concurrent Tasks with Android L

This is a sample program that explores the new Document Centric (Concurrent Task) Android Lollipop APIs.

ActivityA can start ActivityB in one of three ways

1. Default method that replaces ActivityA with ActivityB

2. As a concurrent task that is replaced each time

3. As multiple concurrent tasks.

ActivityA can also close a random ActivityB, and each ActivityB can switch to ActivityA or close itself.
